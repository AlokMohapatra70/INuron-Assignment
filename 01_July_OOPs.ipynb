    "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to provide a clear and organized way to structure and design software systems. It emphasizes the concept of objects, which are instances of classes, and allows for the encapsulation of data and behavior within these objects. OOP aims to simplify the development process by breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable units called objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key goals of OOP are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modularity: OOP promotes modular design by encapsulating related data and functionality into objects. This makes it easier to understand and maintain code as different parts of the system can be developed and tested independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Reusability: OOP encourages code reuse through the concept of inheritance. Classes can inherit properties and methods from other classes, allowing for the reuse of existing code and promoting efficient development.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Encapsulation: OOP supports encapsulation, which means that data and methods related to an object are bundled together, providing a level of data protection and abstraction. This helps in controlling access to the object's internal state and ensures that the object's data is modified only through defined methods, maintaining data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Polymorphism: OOP allows for polymorphism, which means that objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass. This promotes flexibility and allows for the use of generic code that can work with objects of different types, enhancing code reusability and extensibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "By achieving these goals, OOP promotes code organization, reusability, maintainability, and scalability, making it easier to develop complex software systems."

    "In Python, an object is a fundamental concept of object-oriented programming (OOP). An object is an instance of a class, which serves as a blueprint for creating objects with specific attributes (data) and behaviors (methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create an object, you are creating a unique instance that has its own identity, state, and behavior. Each object has a unique identity, which is usually represented by its memory address in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects in Python have the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Identity: Each object has a unique identity that distinguishes it from other objects. You can think of it as the object's address in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "State: Objects have state, which is defined by their attributes or properties. These attributes store the data associated with the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavior: Objects have behavior, which is defined by their methods. Methods are functions that are associated with the object and can perform actions or provide functionality specific to the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects in Python can interact with each other by invoking methods or accessing attributes of other objects. This interaction allows for building complex systems and implementing relationships between objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an object in Python, you typically instantiate a class by calling its constructor. For example, if you have a class called Person, you can create an object of that class as follows:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    person = Person()\n",
    "    \n",
    "The object person is now an instance of the Person class, and you can access its attributes and invoke its methods.\n",

    "In a class, attributes and methods are the two main components that define the behavior and characteristics of objects created from that class.\n",

    "Attributes: Attributes are variables that hold data associated with the class or its instances (objects). They define the state or characteristics of the objects. Attributes can be of different data types, such as integers, strings, lists, or even other objects. There are two types of attributes in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Class attributes: These attributes are shared by all instances of the class. They are defined within the class but outside of any methods. Class attributes have the same value for all instances of the class.\n",

    "\n",
    "Static methods: These methods are decorated with the @staticmethod decorator and are defined within the class. They do not have access to either instance attributes or class attributes.
